The code will run on Google Collab without any issues. However, Pyspark refuses to work for both my local computer and through the Dockerfile. See the Gen AI Disclosure.

In section 1: The code calculates the tf-idf and plots the tf and tf-idf measures in two different histograms. The data is downloaded from github. It is a file expected to have two columns, one called _c0 for the document id and
another called frequency which contains a list of all the words in the document. 

In section 2: The code will calculate the loss in an SVM model. There are 3 files downloaded from Github. One file provides the data with 63 features and the classification. Another file provides the weights which is a 1d row
with 63 columns. The last file will provide a single value. There are two loss SVMs functions built. The first one is one that follows the homework instructions. The second one is an additional function that can be ignored.
The second function rounds the classification to 1 or -1. The functions will only output a value which is the loss or L(w,b).

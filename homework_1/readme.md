### Code Run
To run the code, you can either run it on docker natively or run it on Google Collab. There is no need to install any additional packages. This Jupyter Notebook takes in the T_F41SCHEUDLE_B43.zip file and outputs my answers to DE_300 Spring 2025 homework 1. We expect the zip file to include a csv that holds a 132,313 row, 17 column dataframe.

### Expected Outputs
Parts 1 and 2 utilize different data cleaning methods to fill in missing data and standardize data. In part 3, we drop rows with NA values. We expect the dataframe to now include 101,203 rows and 16 columns. One column is dropped for its repetitiveness. 

In part 4, there are 5 histogram outputs and 1 table output. These are histograms of 4 different columns, number of seats and capacity in pounds and their Box-Cox transformations. There are two new columns in the dataframe, but no change in the number of rows.
In part 5, there are 2 histogram outputs. These depict the distributions of Operating Status and Aircraft Status. No manipulation is done to the dataframe.

There are some warnings scattered throughout the code outputs, but those do not impact the results of the code.

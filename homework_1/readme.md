### Code Run
To run the code, you can either run it on docker natively or run it on Google Collab. There is no need to install any additional packages.

### Expected Outputs
When you run the code, parts 1 to 3 do not output any plots. There are code and array outputs of tables to examine the data. There are also basic number outputs.
In part 1, there are 16 table outputs and 15 np.array outputs.
In part 2, there are 6 table outputs and 1 array outputs.
In part 3, there are only 2 tuple outputs.

In part 4 and 5, there are histograms output too.
In part 4, there are 5 histogram outputs and 1 table output. Before these outputs, there are numbers output that represent the normal test and skew tests.
In part 5, there are 2 histogram outputs.

There are some warnings scattered throughout the code outputs, but those do not impact the results of the code.
